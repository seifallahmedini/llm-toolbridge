# PLANNING.md

## Project Overview

The goal is to develop a Python library that simplifies function (tool) calling integration with Azure OpenAI and other Large Language Models (LLMs). This library should abstract away complexities, providing developers with intuitive interfaces to perform tool calling effectively across multiple providers. Additionally, the library must support calling multiple tools simultaneously in a single call.

## Objectives
- Enable seamless integration with Azure OpenAI and potentially other providers.
- Provide an easy-to-use, extensible, and well-documented Python API.
- Handle complex scenarios of tool calling including synchronous, asynchronous workflows, and simultaneous multiple tool calls.
- Offer structured output for easier downstream processing.

## Milestones

### Phase 1: Initial Setup and Architecture
- Set up repository structure and dependencies.
- Define core classes and interfaces.
- Outline data structures for requests and responses.

### Phase 2: Integration with Azure OpenAI
- Implement Azure OpenAI client integration.
- Develop utility functions for making requests and handling responses.
- Provide clear documentation for setup and authentication.

### Phase 3: Abstracted Function Calling Interface
- Design a unified API for function calling.
- Implement adapters to integrate additional LLM providers easily.
- Ensure extensibility through plugins or provider modules.
- Add capability to invoke multiple tools in a single request.

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Add support for asynchronous calls.
- Implement robust error handling and retry logic.
- Develop comprehensive logging and debugging utilities.

### Phase 5: Testing and Documentation
- Write unit and integration tests.
- Establish CI/CD workflows for automated testing.
- Produce extensive API documentation with examples and tutorials.

### Phase 6: Release Preparation
- Perform code reviews and optimizations.
- Prepare packaging for PyPI.
- Conduct beta testing with community feedback.

## Tech Stack
- Python (>=3.9)
- Azure SDK for Python
- OpenAI Python Client
- Requests/HTTPX for HTTP interactions
- Pydantic for data validation and serialization

## Risk Management
- **Provider Changes:** Regularly monitor provider API updates and adapt accordingly.
- **Compatibility Issues:** Ensure extensive testing across Python versions and environments.
- **Scalability Concerns:** Optimize for performance and extensibility from initial design.

## Optional Extensions
- CLI tool for direct usage.
- Web-based dashboard for monitoring calls.
- Integrations with popular frameworks such as FastAPI, Django, and Flask.

## Next Steps
- Begin Phase 1: Set up project environment and define interfaces.
